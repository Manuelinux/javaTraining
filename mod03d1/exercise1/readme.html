<H3>Exercise #1: Investigate Reference Assignment</H3>
<H3>(Level 2)</H3>
</CENTER>


<H3>Objective</H3>

<P>
In this exercise you will investigate Java reference variables;
object creation and reference variable assignment.
</P>


<H3>Directions</H3>

<P>
Using the <TT>MyPoint</TT> class, which has been supplied for you,
create a <TT>TestMyPoint</TT> program that does the following:
</P>

<P>

<OL><TT></TT>

  <LI>Declare two variables of type <TT>MyPoint</TT> called: <TT>start</TT> and <TT>end</TT>.
      Assign both of these variables a new <TT>MyPoint</TT> object.
      <P>

  <LI>Set the <TT>x</TT> and <TT>y</TT> values of <TT>start</TT> to <TT>10</TT>.
      Set the <TT>x</TT> value of <TT>end</TT> to 20 and the <TT>y</TT> value
      to <TT>30</TT>.
      <P>

  <LI>Print out both point variables.  Use code similar to:<BR>
      <TT>System.out.println("Start point is " + start);</TT>
      <P>

  <LI>Compile and run <TT>TestMyPoint</TT>.
      <P>

  <LI>Declare a new variable of type <TT>MyPoint</TT> and call it <TT>stray</TT>.
     <BR>
      Assign <TT>stray</TT> the reference value of the existing variable <TT>end</TT>.
      <P>

  <LI>Print out <TT>stray</TT> and <TT>end</TT>.
      <P>

  <LI>Assign new values to the x and y members of the variable <TT>stray</TT>.
     <BR>
      Print out <TT>stray</TT>, <TT>end</TT> and <TT>start</TT>.
      <P>

  <LI>Compile and run <TT>TestMyPoint</TT>.
      The values reported by <TT>end</TT> reflect the change made in <TT>stray</TT>,
      indicating that both variables refer to the same <TT>MyPoint</TT> object.
      However, <TT>start</TT> has not changed which indicates that it is
      independent of the other two variables.
      <P>
      The output should look like this:
      <P>
<PRE>
Start point is [10,10]
End point is [20,30]

Stray point is [20,30]
End point is [20,30]

Stray point is [47,30]
End point is [47,30]
Start point is [10,10]
</PRE>

</OL>
